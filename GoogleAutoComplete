Google Autocomplete feature 

Autocomplete = fast prefix lookup (trie / FST / inverted-index) → generate candidates → rank top-K by a scoring function (popularity, recency, CTR, personalization, signals).

Functional Requirements
* As the user types in the search box, show top-k suggestions in real time.
* Suggestions should be ranked by popularity, personalisation, recency, and relevance.
* Must support spell corrections and synonyms.
* Handle trillions of queries efficiently across the globe.
* Low latency (<100ms) per request.


Non-Functional Requirements
* Scalability: Handle billions of queries/day.
* High availability (99.99% uptime).
* Low latency (<100ms end-to-end).
* Consistency vs freshness: trade-off between fast results vs reflecting new trends.


High-Level Architecture
Flow when user types:
1. Client: Sends partial query (e.g., "new y") to backend via API.
2. API Gateway: Receives request → forwards to autocomplete service.
3. Autocomplete Service:
    * Uses prefix index/trie (for fast lookup).
    * Fetches candidate suggestions.
    * Passes through ranking model (ML-based scoring).
    * Returns top-k results.
4. Response: Sent back to client in <100ms.

Core Components
a) Data Collection
* Logs from Search Queries.
* Weighted by frequency, recency, click-through rate (CTR).
b) Storage / Index
* Use Trie / Prefix Tree or FST (Finite State Transducer) for efficient prefix lookups.
* Store along with popularity score.
* For distributed scale → use sharded inverted index (like Lucene / Elasticsearch).
c) Ranking Engine
* Features: frequency, recency, user location, personalization, trending signals.
* ML model (e.g., Gradient Boosted Trees, Transformers) ranks candidates.
d) Caching
* Heavy caching for popular prefixes (e.g., “new y” → "new york", "new year").
* CDN / Edge caching for global scale.
e) Freshness Layer
* Real-time streaming pipeline (Kafka + Flink / Spark Streaming) to update trending queries.


Scaling Considerations
* Sharding by prefix ranges: e.g., all queries starting with “a-f” on shard 1.
* Multi-region deployment for global availability.
* Asynchronous updates for index (batch + stream).
* Cold start problem: show fallback from global popularity if no personalisation.
